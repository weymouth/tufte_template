\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

Welcome to the book template!
This template is based on our previous book.\cite{Kochenderfer2019}

\section{Using Julia}

In this section we provide some examples of how Julia algorithms can be typeset, tested, etc.
We begin with a Julia algorithm, \cref{alg:sample_function}.
We use our custom \texttt{algorithm} environment with a pythontex \texttt{juliaverbatim} environment inside to typeset the algorithm.
A caption provides some additional information, and shows up in the margin.

\begin{algorithm}
\begin{juliaverbatim}
function sample_function(x, a)
	if x > a
		return log(x)
	else
		return x + log(a) - a
	end
end
\end{juliaverbatim}
\caption{
	\label{alg:sample_function}
	A sample function that takes in an evaluation scalar \jlv{x} and a scalar parameter \jlv{a}.
}
\end{algorithm}

We can add a test for our algorithm in the source code.
This test does not show up when you compile.
You can run all tests by executing \texttt{jl runtests.jl}.

\begin{juliatest}
let
	@test isapprox(sample_function(1.0, 2), -0.30685, atol=1e-5)
	@test isapprox(sample_function(1.0, 3), -0.90139, atol=1e-5)
	@test isapprox(sample_function(1.5, 2), 0.19315, atol=1e-5)
end
\end{juliatest}

The code can be executed when creating figures.
\Cref{fig:sample_function} is a standard inline figure that executes Julia code using \jlpkg{PGFPlots} to produce a \TeX file in the \texttt{\\fig} directory.
This file is then compiled into the PDF.

\begin{figure}
	\begin{jlcode}
	p = let
		xs = collect(range(0.0,stop=10.0,length=101))
		plots = Plots.Plot[]
		for a in [1,2,3,5]
			push!(plots,
				Plots.Linear(xs, [sample_function(x, a) for x in xs],
				   style="solid, thick, mark=none", legendentry="parameter \$a = $a\$"))
		end
		Axis(plots, width="8cm", height="5cm", xlabel=L"x", ylabel="sample function output",
					style="cycle list name = pastelcolors",
		 		    legendPos="outer north east")
	end
	plot(p)
	\end{jlcode}
	\begin{center}
		\plot{fig/sample_function}
	\end{center}
	\caption{
		\label{fig:sample_function}
		Curves obtained when using \jlv{sample_function} for several different values of \jlv{a}.
	}
\end{figure}

Of course, there is nothing stopping you from inserting tikzpictures directly, as shown in \cref{fig:sample_tikzpicture}.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[x=1cm, y=1cm]
		\draw[pastelBlue] (0,0) rectangle (2,2);
		\fill[pastelRed]  (3,-1) rectangle ++(2,1);
		\fill[pastelPurple]  (7,0.5) circle (0.5);
		\node[anchor=south] at (4,0) {red rectangle};
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{
		\label{fig:sample_tikzpicture}
		A figure made using a \texttt{tikzpicture} environment.
	}
\end{figure}

Figures can also be placed in the margins, as with \cref{fig:sample_marginfigure}.
\begin{marginfigure}
	\begin{jlcode}
	p = let
		Axis(Plots.Linear(x->sin(x) + x, (0,10), style="solid, pastelBlue, mark=none"),
			 width="5cm", height="5cm", xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"f(x)")
	end
	plot(p)
	\end{jlcode}
	\begin{center}
		\plot{fig/sample_marginfigure}
	\end{center}
	\caption{
		\label{fig:sample_marginfigure}
		A \texttt{marginfigure} shows up in the margin.
	}
\end{marginfigure}


The \texttt{pythontex} package also supports the \texttt{juliaconsole} environment, as shown below.
These environments act like the julia REPL, showing code as it is entered and executed.
\begin{juliaconsole}
x = 5
y = 7.5
x^y
\end{juliaconsole}

\section{Custom Environments}

We created two custom environments in addition to the \texttt{algorithm} environment when writing \textit{Algorithms for Optimization}.
The \texttt{example} environment creates an isolated section in a light-gray box with its own caption.

\begin{example}
	An example of the \texttt{example} environment.
	Place anything you want here, including figures.
	\caption{
		\label{ex:sample_example}
		An example \texttt{example}.
	}
\end{example}

We also have \texttt{question} and \texttt{solution} environments, typically used at the end of each chapter.
The solutions can automatically be placed at the end of the book by using \texttt{solutionappendix}.

\begin{question}
	What is the meaning of life?
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
	The meaning of life is \num{42}.
\end{solution}

\section{Math Notation}

\textit{Algorithms for Optimization} uses lowercase characters with bold face for vectors, such as $\vect x$, and uppercase characters with bold face for matrices, such as $\mat \Sigma$.
Scalars are lowercase with normal face, such as $\lambda$.

The contents of vectors and matrices can be typeset using \texttt{bmatrix}:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix} = \\
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\Sigma_{11} & \Sigma_{12} \\
		\Sigma_{21} & \Sigma_{22}
	\end{bmatrix}^{-1}
	\begin{bmatrix}y_1 \\ y_2\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

We often write out vectors horizontally in order to save space.
In these cases, we use comma-separate entries:
\begin{equation}
	\vect x = [x_1, x_2]
\end{equation}

We construct an optimization problem as follows:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
        \minimize_{\vect x} & & f(\vect x)\\
        \subjectto & & g(\vect x) \leq \vect 0 \\
        		   & & h(\vect x) = \vect 0
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

See \texttt{tufte\_algorithm\_book.cls} for some additional math utilities, such as $\gaussian{\mu}{\nu}$ and $\card{\mathcal{A}}$.

\section{Code Replacement}

Sometimes the function you want typeset is almost, but not quite, the function that you want to also execute or test.
For example, you may want to inject an extra line to store data into a global variable, or you may wish to replace a particular function with a specialized version.

For such cases we have a simple replacement feature built into the \texttt{pull\_julia\_code} script.
The script searches for \jlv{"REPLACE \(.*\) \(.*\)"} in the lines between the beginning of the \texttt{algorithm} environment and the beginning of the \texttt{juliaverbatim} environment.
It will then match the string between the first parentheses and replace it with the string between the second parentheses when exporting the code.
The code block will still be typeset with exactly what is inside the environment --- it is only the exported code that is changed.

This feature was intended to be used sparingly.

\begin{algorithm}
% REPLACE (return x^2) (return sin(x))
\begin{juliaverbatim}
function replacement_example(x)
	return x^2
end
\end{juliaverbatim}
\caption{
	\label{alg:replacement_example}
	A sample typeset algorithm whose exported code differs from what is typeset.
	Here the \jlv{x^2} will be replaced with \jlv{sin(x)}.
}
\end{algorithm}

\begin{marginfigure}[6cm]
	\begin{jlcode}
	p = let
		Axis(Plots.Linear(replacement_example, (0,10), style="solid, pastelBlue, mark=none"),
			 width="5cm", height="5cm", xlabel=L"x", ylabel=L"f(x)")
	end
	plot(p)
	\end{jlcode}
	\begin{center}
		\plot{fig/replacement_example}
	\end{center}
	\caption{
		\label{fig:sample_marginfigure}
		We find that when using \cref{alg:replacement_example}, we actually get $f(x) = \sin(x)$ due to the replacement going on under the hood.
	}
\end{marginfigure}

\section{Conclusion}

That is more or less everything you need in order to get started writing your own textbook with the \texttt{tufte\_algorithm\_book} style.
We hope you find it useful.
