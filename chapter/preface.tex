This book template provides a starting point upon which authors may freely build to generate their own textbook entirely in \LaTeX.
We used this setup for Algorithms for Optimization, and have continued to refine it for a new textbook on decision making under uncertainty.
The template allows for the direct compilation of a print-ready PDF, including support for figures, examples, and exercises.

This template is intended for textbook authors.
Use of the template assumes prior expose to \LaTeX.
This template uses the \texttt{tufte-book} class to provide wide side margins.

Fundamental to our textbooks are the algorithms, which are all implemented in the Julia programming language.
We have found the language to be ideal for specifying algorithms in human readable form.
Algorithms can be typeset in algorithm blocks, tested, and used to generate figures.
We use pygments and pythontex, including a custom pygments lexer and style.

We hope that you find this useful.
