The authors wish to thank the many individuals who have provided valuable feedback on early drafts of our manuscript, including
Adam Adamson,
Barry Barryson,
Cindy Cindyson, and
Daryl Darylson.
In addition, it has been a pleasure working with our editor from the MIT Press in preparing this manuscript for publication.

The style of this book was inspired by Edward Tufte.
Among other stylistic elements, we adopted his wide margins and use of small multiples.
In fact, the typesetting of this book is heavily based on the Tufte-LaTeX package by Kevin Godby, Bil Kleb, and Bill Wood.

We have also benefited from the various open source packages on which this textbook depends.
The typesetting of the code is done with the help of pythontex, which is maintained by Geoffrey Poore.
Plotting is handled by pgfplots, which is maintained by Christian Feuers\"{a}nger.
The book's color scheme was adapted from the Monokai theme by Jon Skinner of Sublime Text (\url{sublimetext.com}).
For plots, we use the viridis colormap defined by St\'efan van der Walt and Nathaniel Smith.
